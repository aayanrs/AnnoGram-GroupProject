To edit the program:
1. Set the program up in your browser for testing.
2. Open VScode, and make the required changes. Remember to update the manifest with any new permissions needed, and to refer to the Chrome Developer Guide often. https://developer.chrome.com/
3. If the images used for the logo of the extension want to be changed, make sure all images remain inside of the respective folder
4. Html tags cannot use complex js <script> commands. Seperate them into files and edit object details (innerHTML, ect).
